My name is Johannes Unterguggenberger. I am a real-rime rendering engineer and researcher and live in Vienna, Austria, where I'm working as predoctoral university assistant in the [Research Unit of Computer Graphics](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at) of [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at). 

### Technology and GitHub Projects

Currently, I am mostly working with C++17/C++20 and Vulkan, mainly to further the development of a Vulkan convenience and productivity layer called [_Auto-Vk_](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/Auto-Vk) and a C++/Vulkan programming framework called [_Gears-Vk_](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/Gears-Vk).

I'm also using the .NET framework with C# and PowerShell for the development of tools and utils for _Gears-Vk_. In the past, I used C# for various desktop projects in conjunction with WPF, and most notably, also for Unity3D development.
