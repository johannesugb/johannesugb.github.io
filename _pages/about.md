My name is Johannes Unterguggenberger. I am a real-rime rendering engineer and researcher and live in Vienna, Austria, where I'm working as predoctoral university assistant in the [Research Unit of Computer Graphics](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at) of [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at). 

### Technology and GitHub Projects

Currently, I am mostly working with C++17/C++20 and Vulkan, mainly to further the development of a Vulkan convenience and productivity layer called [_Auto-Vk_](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/Auto-Vk) and a C++/Vulkan programming framework called [_Gears-Vk_](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/Gears-Vk).

I'm also using the .NET framework with C# and PowerShell for the development of tools and utils for _Gears-Vk_. In the past, I used C# for various desktop projects in conjunction with WPF, and most notably, also for Unity3D development.

My teaching efforts w.r.t. Vulkan happened to gain some fame recently: The [Vulkan Lecture Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmIqTlJ6KsE1Jx5HV4sd2jOe3V1KMHHgn), provided via our research unit's YouTube channel, has been listed on [vulkan.org -> Learn -> Tutorials](https://www.vulkan.org/learn#vulkan-tutorials), and our paper [The Road to Vulkan: Teaching Modern Low-Level APIs in Introductory Graphics Courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG0ct4V6c0k) has been accepted to Eurographics 2022.
