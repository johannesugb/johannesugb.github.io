Vulkan snchronization validation has reached version 1.0 as reported by [LunarG](www.lunarg.com) on January 13th, 2021. They published an official documentation of if, titled "[Guide to Vulkan Synchronization Validation](https://www.lunarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Final_Guide-to-Vulkan-Synchronization-Validation_Jan_21.pdf)". This article contains the key items of if (sort of a "TL;DR" which might be useful for those are already somewhat familiar with Vulkan synchronization) as well as a quickstart guide how to enable it.

If you are not yet familiar with synchronization, here are two recommendations:
- My [Introduction to Vulkan lecture](https://youtu.be/isbMMIwmZes), where I start to talk about synchronization from [22:30](https://youtu.be/isbMMIwmZes?t=1350) onwards.
- The great "[Yet another blog explaining Vulkan synchronization](http://themaister.net/blog/2019/08/14/yet-another-blog-explaining-vulkan-synchronization)" blog post by [Themaister](https://themaister.net/about.html) which really got me up to speed in terms of Vulkan synchronization.
